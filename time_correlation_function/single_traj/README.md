The following code runs MD for a 1D harmonic oscillator and then computes the velocity autocorrelation function from the single trajectory. 

Oscillator must be coupled to a thermostat to verify plot with the known formula for the position autocorrelation function for a harmonic oscillator in the canonical ensemble.

Will generalize to N oscillators soon.
