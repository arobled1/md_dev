Input data that can be used for all RPMD codes in my primitive and staging RPMD
directories. Position samples were obtained in cartesian coordinates from a
PIMD calculation (see 'closed_chain_pimd' directory for algorithm) done in
staging coordinates and then back transformed every N steps.

Note: the temperature in the RPMD simulations is rescaled from T to P*T as the
RPMD Hamiltonian used is from the paper by Perez et al listed below.
